///When working with an array response, and some items may be corrupted, use this class
///to prevent one corrupted item from ruining the array. For example, when articles come in,
///some do not follow the rules (a missing author for example). When using combine (and
///tryMap specifically in Agent.swift), a corrupted Article will end the entire stream (if 20 articles
///are fetched and the 9th is corrupted, a user will end up with 9 visible Articles). Use this class
///when one failed item should not stop the whole show.
