# Reed
SwiftUI &amp; Combine proof of concept

Reed is a blog-reader. It consumes a news API and displays articles given some filter parameters. It requires iOS 14+ and Xcode 12+. It uses the new (not legacy) build system, and has a SPM dependency called CancelBag.

The purpose of this app is to demonstrate the usefulness and power of SwiftUI and Combine.
